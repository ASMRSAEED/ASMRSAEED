### Hi there 👋, I'm A. S M Rafiqullah
#### Frontend Developer

To follow my passion and create amazing things with amazing people. I've spent the last year diving deep into Web Development. Completing the Programming Hero Web Course, I journeyed through the basics to advance web development. Learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Express.js, React Query, React Router, JWT, Stripe Payments System. Creating some Dynamic websites. From there, I continued to the Full Stack Developer, focusing on the MERN stack, where I collaborated with outstanding individuals on group projects and also created solo projects that I am proud of. Endlessly learning and building my skills more every day and seeing what I am producing grow into projects I am proud to show ignites my soul.

Skills: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Express.js, React Query, React Router, JWT, Stripe Payments System.
